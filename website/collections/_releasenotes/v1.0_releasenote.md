New rules to compute the Reprocessing data baseline for S1 have been implemented:
- L0 Sensor based selection of Aux Types
- L0 Polarization based selection of Aux Types
- ICID (Instrument Configuration IDentifier) based selection of Aux Files
- Max time difference between Aux Files and L0 product

In addition, the baseline for Sentinel-1 L2OCN has been updated to include the Aux Types for the processing of the processor generated intermediate L1 Products.

#### L0 Sensor Based Selection of Aux Types
A configuration specifies if an Aux Type is linked to specific Sensors.
E.g. AUX_SCS is used for WM and SM L0 products

#### L0 Polarizatin Based Selection of Aux Types
A configuration specifies if an Aux Type is linked to a particular Polarization of the L0 Product
E.g. AMV_ERRMAT is used for L0 products with vertical polarization
AMH_ERRMAT is used for L0 products with horizotal polarization

#### ICID based selection of Aux Files
For some Aux Types, the Selection rule is applied not to all the available Aux Files, but only to the Aux Files having the same ICID as the L0 Product.
First the ICID for the L0 product is retrieved by searching in a configuration table specifying time intervals when the differnt applied ICID values were effective on board of the satellites.
Then the retrieved ICID value is used to filter the Aux Files for the Aux Type being considered; on the filtered Aux Files, the usual Selection Rule is applied.

#### Max Time Difference 
To take into account Aux Files that are not considered by the image processor if they have a validity that is too far back in time with respect to the L0 product to be processed, a configuration can be set to specify the max Time difference between the Aux Files of one Aux Type and the L0 Product to be processed.
The Aux Files that have a greater time difference are discarded and not considered by the Selection Rule.
